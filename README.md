### Data
Drone Attacks and Suicide Bombings: Pakistan Body Count (http://www.pakistanbodycount.org/) has a database of every drone strike that has happened since 2004. Their data is collected from media reports, hospitals and internet in an attempt to show the world the kind of brutality that these attacks bring with them.  The data for suicide bombings is also available on the same site. The data is in numerical format with the details of every attack like- date, time, place, no. of civilians killed, no. of Talibani killed, no. of Al-Qaeda men killed, no. of foreigners killed, no. of people injured, women/children involved etc.
